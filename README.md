# Code used in Pisokas, I. "Reverse Engineering and Robotics as Tools for Analyzing Neural Circuits". Frontiers in Neurorobotics, 2020. 

This is the code accompanying the Pisokas, I. "Reverse Engineering and Robotics as Tools for Analyzing Neural Circuits". Frontiers in Neurorobotics, 2020. It uses the code in the directory Kakaria_deBivort_2017/ for running the simulations. The code in Kakaria_deBivort_2017/ is modified version of the code made available by Kakaria and de Bivort, 2017.

The directory Exp_Recurrent_PB_EB/ contains the code used for the paper Pisokas, I. "Reverse Engineering and Robotics as Tools for Analyzing Neural Circuits". Frontiers in Neurorobotics, 2020.


# Usage

Both directories and subdirectories must be added in Matlab path. 

Running the script collect_stats_long_run.m will run the simulations using the fruit fly heading time series in fruit_fly_trajectories.mat and collect all the data used in the plots (this code has been tested with Matlab2016b). The script contains instructions and list of the ways it was invoked to procude each of the data sets. The script real_fruit_fly_heading_tracking_analysis.mlx will reproduce the fruit fly heading plots included in the paper (the code has been tested with Matlab2016b and Matlab2020a).
